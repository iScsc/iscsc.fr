# iscsc.fr

This is the iScsc website source code.
**This website is still under development**

## MERN

The tech stack I chose for this web application is MERN with:

- MongoDB for the database
- Express for the API
- React for the frontend
- Node.js for the backend

For more information, check [this article](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).
You can also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) if you want to get more familiar with the stack.
If you're a true beginner, you can follow [this Open Classroom course](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5614116-go-full-stack-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb).

## 1. Functionalities ([toc](#table-of-contents))

At the moment, the main functionalities of the website are creating, reading, and deleting posts in the blog section. Posts are rendered in Markdown, with the [Github Flavored Markdown, GFM](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). To create and delete posts, you need to authenticate. You can sign up and log in with an email and password.
JWT and cookies allow the user to stay logged in.

### Create

You can create your post in the /create-article route. **Creating a post requires authentication.**

Two options are available:

- Submitting a markdown file.  
  This option is recommended. You can use the available markdown file template.
- Writing directly in the form input field.  
  At the moment, there is no editor on the website, so you need to write directly in the Textarea field.

When creating a post, a preview is available on the right side of your browser. Your username will appear as the author of the article.

### Read

You can read articles submitted by other users in the /blog route

### Delete

You can only delete articles that **you created**.

Note: if you try to delete an article you did not write, it won't work but you won't receive any error message.

## 2. Deployment ([toc](#table-of-contents))

To run the website, you need to:

- set the environment variables `.env.*` file
- set up MongoDB host folder
- start frontend, backend and database

For deployment, `development` and `production` modes are available.

> **Notes for the iScsc members:**
>
> Send me a message, and I'll send you back an encrypted version of the official `.env.production` and `.env.development` files.

Here is a quick guide after cloning the repository:

### 2.1 Set up the local MongoDB folder ([toc](#table-of-contents))

To make the database persistent through containers starting and stopping, the database folder is shared with the host using a `docker` volume. You can see it in the [docker compose files](./docker-compose.yml).

> :warning::warning: **IMPORTANT**: the following script will give rwx permissions on the DB folder to the UID 1001 due to bitnami/mongodb image [constraint](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mongodb) (the _Note_ under "Persisting your database"). If, on your system, it already exists and shouldn't have this access, please consider modifying the image!

However, because the bitnami/mongodb container is a non-root container, we've got to set up the right permission on that folder.

- To set it up, run:

```bash
./scripts/setup-db-folder.sh
```

### 2.2 Development mode ([toc](#table-of-contents))

You have two choices to run the development mode:

a) with [`docker`](#docker)  
b) [manually](#manually-on-host) start the backend, frontend and set up a DB

#### Set the environment variables (.env.development file)

- From the root directory of the repository, do the following:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

After copying the example config of `.env`, you must fill in the missing information in this file. Check the example for more information.

#### a) Run Docker

- Once your `.env.development` is [ready](#envdevelopment-file), run:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.development --file docker-compose-dev.yml up -d --build
```

Make sure the `docker` daemon is running with `systemctl status docker`, or start it with `systemctl start docker`

The website is now up on `$CLIENT_URL` (specified in the `.env.development` file)

- To see the running application, and check the logs, use:

```bash
docker ps
docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>
```

- Finally, you can stop it with:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.development --file docker-compose-dev.yml down
```

#### b) Run manually on host

##### 1. Start backend

You will need `nodemon` to run the backend. Use `npm install -g nodemon` to install it. Make sure you're supporting at least 2.0.20 with `nodemon --version`. Nodemon has been tested working fine with node 19.

- From the root directory of the repository, do the following:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

##### 2. Start frontend

Make sure you're using at least version 8.19.2 by checking `npm --version`, and update if needed with `npm update`.

- From the root directory of the repository, do the following:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

##### 3. Start database

Start a MongoDB either in a container and expose a port or directly on your host with the right port configured. Then set up properly the .env. It should work, but this is untested.

### 2.3 Production mode ([toc](#table-of-contents))

The production mode allows to deploy the application on the server. To use it, you will need:

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

#### Set the environment variables (.env.production file)

- From the root directory of the repository, do the following:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
```

#### Create SSL certificates

To set up HTTPS, you will need valid SSL certificates.

a) If you deploy the app **for the first time**, follow these instructions:

1. Comment or delete the whole server section about 443 in the `nginx/nginx.conf.template` file.

```diff
- server {
- listen 443 default_server ssl http2;
- ...
- }
```

This step is required because the certificates don't exist yet, so they cannot be loaded in the nginx configuration.

2. (Re)Start the `nginx` container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production up -d --build
```

3. Create the certificates with the `certbot` container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production run --rm certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d yourdomainname.com
```

4. Restore the original `nginx/nginx.conf.template` (with `git restore nginx/nginx.conf.template` for example)
5. Stop the `nginx` container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production down
```

The certificates should have been generated in `certbot/conf/live/yourdomainname.com/`

b) If you want to **renew existing certificates**, use:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production run --rm certbot renew
```

#### Run docker

- Once everything is ready, run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production up -d --build
```

Make sure the `docker` daemon is running with `systemctl status docker`, or start it with `systemctl start docker`

Your application can now be started on `$CLIENT_URL` (specified in the `.env.production` file)

- To see the running application, and check the logs, use:

```bash
sudo docker ps
sudo docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>
```

- Finally, you can stop the production mode with:

```bash
sudo docker-compose --env-file .env.production down
```
